[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once it ships releasable artifacts.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Architecture and governance scaffold: `README`, `ARCHITECTURE`, ADR practice
  (`docs/adr/`), `CONTRIBUTING`, `SECURITY`, this changelog.
- Repo consistency + collaboration tooling: `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`,
  expanded `.gitignore`, CODEOWNERS, PR/issue templates, Dependabot, guardrail CI.
- Vetted, Markdown-only Claude Code skills under `.claude/skills/` and an upgraded
  `CLAUDE.md` operating agreement.
- Board pitch under `Board pitch/`: a 2-page decision brief (`.docx`) and an
  8-slide deck (`.pptx`), both generated from the `Project planning/` source of
  truth, plus their build scripts. The deck ends on the ask (read-only access,
  Azure environment, governance liaisons); the brief adds the developer tooling /
  hardware / budget request.

### Changed
- Recalibrated the board pitch per stakeholder review: reframed from "convert
  competitor sell-through for margin" to "give the Owned Brands team the data
  signals to help WCO sellers win deals and hold margin." Clarified that platform
  users are the OB sales team, their call targets are WCO sellers + select WCO
  customers, and the build is solo.
- Second pitch pass: positive "stronger signals" framing; org-wide win-rate/margin
  payoff; OB-only access stated explicitly (no org-wide access); elevated the "the
  WCO seller is our customer, not tracked in USD" insight; added opportunity-loss
  and product-development signals; removed all em-dashes; budget set to TBD.
- Renamed anonymization aliases repo-wide: `OBCO` → `WCO`, `OB_Vend` → `LCO`,
  so the whole repo matches the pitch.
- Third pitch pass: added a concrete worked example (a security-bid deal), a
  "why now" beat (LCO integration momentum) with a first-90-day KPI of 30
  saved opportunities, a value-loop graphic on the brief, and a prototype
  screenshot slide in the deck (captured from the wireframe). Deck grew to 10
  slides. Spelled out CORE/USD as ERP/CRM. Removed em-dashes from the wireframe
  (`index.html`) too.
